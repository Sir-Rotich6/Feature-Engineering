# Feature-Engineering
Learn all bout feature engineering a machine learning model, the main goals here is simply to make your data better suited to the problem hand, improve a model's predictive performance, reduce computational or data needs and improve interpretability of the results.
# Welcome to Feature Engineering!
In this course you'll learn about one of the most important steps on the way to building a great machine learning model: feature engineering. You'll learn how to:

determine which features are the most important with mutual information
invent new features in several real-world problem domains
encode high-cardinality categoricals with a target encoding
create segmentation features with k-means clustering
decompose a dataset's variation into features with principal component analysis
